# **Bank of Unit Testamania: Secure the Vault with Unit Tests! 🏦🔐**

## Overview
As an engineer, it is a major responsibility to write code that is not only safe but serves its intended purpose. Writing unit tests is an esssential skill that allows you to not only verify your code's functionality but also build your confidence in writing quality code. You will be taken through a scenario that will test your ability to validate code.


## Scenario  

Welcome to the **Bank of Unit Testamania**, the most technologically advanced bank in the world! Our clients use our bank for secure transactions, convenient banking, and most importantly error-free service.

There is a problem, however...

Our software developer has decided to leave **Bank of Unit Testamania** for our competitor, **GlitchyBank**! The developer unfortunately did not write unit tests for his software, and we are unable to verify its functionality. This is where **you** come in!

As a **Software Quality Engineer**, your goal is to write **unit tests that expose and prevent financial disasters** before they happen. Millions of our customers are counting on you! 💰💻 

## Your Mission  

You must test the **core banking operations** to make sure everything is functioning correctly:  

✅ **Account Creation** – Are new accounts properly initialized?  
✅ **Deposits & Withdrawals** – Can users add and remove money safely?  
✅ **Secure Transfers** – Do funds move correctly between accounts?  
✅ **Overdraft Protection** – Are transactions blocked when funds are insufficient?  
✅ **Interest Calculations** – Are customers earning the right amount of interest?  

Failure to test these functions properly could lead to **bankruptcy, customer outrage, and financial chaos!** 🚨
